Note:
• Some stuff in XiaomiParts is related to Kernel Tweaks, So use them if you know what you're doing ( I'm not responsible for your mobile )
• As 4.9 Kernel still have somethings missing, so in XiaomiParts you might face somethings not working properly.
I tried to fix as many as i could, so if still something isn't working please be patient, don't SPAM and wait for fix from kernel side.
